        associated areas. Different areas of C-DAC, had originated at different times, many of which came out as
        a result of identification of opportunities.
        ✓ The setting up of C-DAC in 1988 itself was to built Supercomputers in context of denial of import of
        Supercomputers by USA. Since then C-DAC has been undertaking building of multiple generations of Supercomputer
        starting from PARAM with 1 GF in 1988.
        ✓ Almost at the same time, C-DAC started building Indian Language Computing Solutions with setting up of
        GIST group (Graphics and Intelligence based Script Technology); National Centre for Software Technology (NCST)
        set up in 1985 had also initiated work in Indian Language Computing around the same period.
        ✓ Electronic Research and Development Centre of India (ER&DCI) with various constituents starting as
        adjunct entities of various State Electronic Corporations, had been brought under the hold of Department
        of Electronics and Telecommunications (now MeitY) in around 1988.
